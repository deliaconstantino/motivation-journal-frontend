# Motivation Journal

Motivation Journal is a Single Page Application that allows a user to set a timer for writing journal entries. Upon the completion of the timer, a user has the option to save or delete their journal entry.

This repo is the front end for the Motivation Journal App. It uses CSS, HTML, and JavaScript along with Bootstrap for styling.

The back end of the app can be found in the Github Repo: motivation-journal-backend at https://github.com/deliaconstantino/motivation-journal-backend with specific instructions for database creation, seed data, and running the Rails server. Note that the back end will need to be running through Rails server while viewing the front end.

## Configuration

* To get started with Motivation Journal, fork and clone this front end repo.

* Ensure that your back end is fully set up and running Rails server.

* run `open index.html` from the command line in the front end app. This will open motivation journal up in a browser window, powered by your local environment.

Enjoy!
